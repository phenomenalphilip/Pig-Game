<h1>Pig Game in Python</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
I created a dice game that allows for a maximum number of 4 players. The players decide what the winning score would be. Each player can roll as many times as they wish during a turn. Every time they roll a number greater than 1, it adds to their total score. If they roll the number 1, their total becomes 0. <br />
